## [Documentation](https://playwright.dev) | [API reference](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright)

Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is **ever-green**, **capable**, **reliable** and **fast**.

### Debugging and running the exact test 
This command will run the tests in UI mode:

```
UI Mode lets you explore, run and debug tests with a time travel experience complete with watch mode. All test files are loaded into the testing sidebar where you can expand each file and describe block to individually run, view, watch and debug each test. Filter tests by text or @tag or by passed, failed and skipped tests as well as by projects as set in your playwright.config file. See a full trace of your tests and hover back and forward over each action to see what was happening during each step and pop out the DOM snapshot to a separate window for a better debugging experience.
